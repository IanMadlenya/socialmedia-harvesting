# Social Media Data Collection

There is a huge potential in mining *big* social media data and **data collection** is the first step for data mining projects.

Even though Social Media Platforms publishes public APIs and document them; it takes time / effort to get necessary data for starting the analysis phase of a data mining project.

In this repo, we share our experience in collecting data from various sources.
