# Social Media Data Collection

There is a huge potential in mining *big* social media data and **data collection** is the first step for data mining projects.

Even though Social Media Platforms publishes public APIs and document them; it takes time / effort to get necessary data for starting the analysis phase of a data mining project.

In this repo, we share our experience in collecting data from various sources.

OpenMaker project is being executed by the support of European Union with aim of accelerating the collaboration between makers and manufacturers. As a part of this project, Boğaziçi University is fetching data from social media platforms to detect dependencies and relations in this big data.
