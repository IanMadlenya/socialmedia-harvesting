# Social Media Data Collection

There is an increasing interest in mining *big* social media data; and **data collection** is the first step in data mining projects.

Social Media Platforms publish well documented public APIs; yet it takes often significant amount of time / effort to collect necessary data for starting the analysis phase of a data mining project.

In this repository, we will share code and documnetation for collecting data from various sources. The documents are jupyter notebooks that both contain documentation, design choices, tips and tricks along with python code. Currently we have the following topics:

- [Introduction to Social Media Authorization](https://github.com/openmaker-eu/socialmedia/blob/master/Introduction%2Bto%2BSocial%2BMedia%2BPlatform%2BAuthorization.ipynb)
- [Twitter Data Collection](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/openmaker-eu/socialmedia/blob/master/Twitter.ipynb)
- [Facebook Data Collection](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/openmaker-eu/socialmedia/blob/master/Facebook.ipynb)
- [Linkedin Data Collection](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/openmaker-eu/socialmedia/blob/master/Linkedin.ipynb)
- [Flickr Data Collection](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/openmaker-eu/socialmedia/blob/master/Flickr.ipynb)
